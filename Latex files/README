This IEEEtran.cls is the official LaTeX class for authors of the
Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) transactions
journals and conferences. In addition to being carried on IEEE's site,
IEEEtran.cls may be found at:

http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/supported/IEEEtran/

The CTAN site may have additional files related to non-IEEE uses of this
tool.

As of version 1.6, IEEEtran.cls now provides support for conferences and
A4 paper. Users of previous versions should no longer manually alter margins,
paper sizes, page styles, etc. Also, please note that \author is used
slightly differently from that of V1.5, especially for conferences.
\pubid (if used) must now be placed before \maketitle. \cite is now robust
and can be used within captions without a proceeding \protect.

As with previous versions, The itemize, enumerate, and description lists as
well as \appendix(ces) have enhanced controls and work slightly differently
than is done in traditional LaTeX.

Extensive formal documentation is now available. Enjoy! ;) The appendices
of the user manual contain important information on avoiding commonly
made mistakes, compatibility issues and installation instructions.


Best wishes for all your publication endeavors,

Version 1.6b (2002/11/18) changes:

 1) New peerreview and peerreviewca modes with \IEEEpeerreviewmaketitle
    command allows for a "cover" titlepage for anonymous peer review.

 2) New draftclsnofoot mode is like draftcls, but does not display the
    date and the word "DRAFT" at the foot of the page. 

 3) The draft modes now no longer force a pagebreak after the title.

 4) \table* now defaults to \footnotesize text like \table.

 5) In addition to the IEEE IED lists, the original IED style lists (as is
    done in article.cls) are now provided as LaTeXitemize, LaTeXenumerate,
    and LaTeXdescription. Also, users can now redefine \makelabel within
    IEEE IED list controls.

 6) Added \special to feed papersize to dvips.

 7) Revised font selection method so as not to have problems when used
    with setspace.sty. 

 8) Extra code to prevent hyperref.sty from interfering with the operation
    of cite.sty.

 9) Fixed problem with figure captions when using hyperref.sty.
